                 Loma Shade may be from another planet, but she’s still like every other twenty something who feels that their life is going nowhere fast. Bored out of her mind, she steals a "madness coat" and astrally projecting herself across space, Loma ends up in the body of Megan Boyer, an Earth girl who seems to have it all: youth, beauty and a conveniently damaged brain. Following her “miraculous” recovery, however, Loma finds there’s just one problem with being Megan: Everyone hates her. She was a bully who terrorized her enemies and her friends alike, and now Loma’s stuck with the consequences.  </p>
