             <p id="rcorners1" style="padding-left: 70px">Sometimes readers crave some obscurity and something less mainstream when looking for a good comic book series. Whether it is by an indie book company or one of the main publishers like Marvel or DC, it can be refreshing to read a story that is a unique read and doesnt need any previous reading material to get into. My goal to remedy this, was a website which documents graphic novels and comic books that: <br>&bull; Have gone unnoticed <br>&bull; Were not considered popular enough to pick up <br>&bull; Were released at an incovenient time <br>But are all perceived as Hidden Gems. That is the goal of this site; to list out hidden gems from across the past two decades.</p>

               <p><b>Author:</b> James Tynion IV <br><b>Artist:</b> Werther Dell'edera <br><b>Publishers:</b> BOOM! Studios <br><b>Brief Description:</b>
                   <br>In a sleepy town in the heart of America, children have started to die in horrific ways. The local police are mystified by the brutal murders, and frantic to catch the killer. But they refuse to believe reports of impossible creatures that lurk in the shadows snatching children and tearing them to pieces, especially since the only people who claim to have seen these so-called monsters are other children. Enter Erica Slaughter, a mysterious stranger who rides into town and claims she can solve their “monster” problem. But can the townspeople trust this dangerous outsider with their children’s lives? And more importantly, can the children trust this strange adult with their secrets?<br> <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Something-Killing-Children-Vol-1/dp/1684155584/ref=sr_1_2?crid=E8M9Q842HNAX&dchild=1&keywords=something+is+killing+the+children&qid=1615321051&s=books&sprefix=somet%2Cstripbooks%2C902&sr=1-2"> <b>Link to purchase</b></a></p>

               <br>The Isles of Los Angeles 2089: Humanity is addicted to technology, a population of unemployed leisure seekers blissfully distracted from toxic contamination, who borrow, steal, and kill to buy their next digital fix. Getting a virtual buzz is the only thing left to live for. It's the biggest industry, the only industry, the drug everyone needs, and gangsters run it all. And who do these gangsters turn to when they need their rule enforced? Constables Led Dent and Debbie Decay. This duo is about to be given a job that will force them out of the familiar squalor of Los Angeles to take down the last tech-less country on Earth: The Garden Nation of Tokyo.<br> <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tokyo-Ghost-1-Atomic-Garden/dp/1632156636/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=tokyo+ghost&qid=1615321364&s=books&sr=1-1"> <b>Link to purchase</b></a></p>
